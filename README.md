## What is this about?
This is one of my first projects that I'm proud of, collecting almost all of the knowledge I know about HTML and CSS. On this site, you will find something about my persona, knowledge and interests in life. Hope I didn't share too much about myself but I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't share any information inside this website or the files inside this repo.
## When was this created?
In reality, this is an old project of mine that I started a year ago for myself while studying HTML and CSS. I continued this project throughout the year and I thought it was a great idea to publish it on GitHub to share my work and my knowledge.
## Why was this created?
I created this project to practice with HTML and CSS. This was supposed to be the final product of all the knowledge I had learned since I started learning web. Of course, it doesn't have everything I learned but it contains a good amount of it.

As I said before I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't share or modify any information you find on the website, the code, or inside files of the repository. Thank you.
